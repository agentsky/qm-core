# Deploy QM for an organization

QM runs on Kubernetes. The chart in [`deploy/helm/`](../deploy/helm) deploys core, which
hosts the Slack integration and the HTTP API, and the egress proxy, from one values file.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` context you can deploy into, plus Helm 3.
- A Postgres database reachable from the cluster. Core keeps its records there (sessions,
  runs, memory, grants, file metadata); supply its URL as `secretEnv.DATABASE_URL`. The
  chart runs core with `SESSION_STORE=postgres` and `RUN_STORE=postgres` so every record
  store is database-backed from the first boot.
- Storage for file bytes. Uploaded files, blob transfers, and workspaces are bytes under
  core's data directory, not rows in Postgres. The chart claims a `ReadWriteOnce`
  persistent volume for it by default (`services.core.persistence`, one replica, pod
  replacement in place), so your cluster needs a default StorageClass or you name one in
  `services.core.persistence.storageClass`. To run more than one core replica, put the
  bytes in S3 instead: set `SNAPSHOT_STORE=s3`, `TRANSFER_STORE=s3`, and `S3_BUCKET` (plus
  `S3_REGION` and the AWS SDK's usual credentials or an IAM role), and disable
  persistence.
- A model. The chart runs core with `HARNESS=pi`, which calls the provider whose key you
  supply; without a harness setting core answers with canned text.
- Service images. Either use the signed images the release workflow publishes to
  `ghcr.io/yc-software/qm` (`image.repository` and `image.tag`), or build and push your
  own from this checkout with [`scripts/deploy-helm.sh`](../scripts/deploy-helm.sh).
- Optional: an ingress controller and cert-manager, if you want core published on a
  hostname with TLS. An ingress is what lets Slack reach core over HTTP, what webhook
  senders post to, and what serves published apps. Slack's Socket Mode does not need one;
  without an ingress, reach core by port-forward.
- A sandbox backend. `SANDBOX_BACKEND=local` runs agent computers as Docker containers
  next to core; the hosted backends (e2b, modal, smolmachines, agent37) need their own
  API key. See [`deploy/sandbox-base/README.md`](../deploy/sandbox-base/README.md).

## Deploy

Write a values file with your own secrets — never commit it. This one is
[`deploy/helm/examples/getting-started.yaml`](../deploy/helm/examples/getting-started.yaml),
and the k3s end-to-end job installs it against a fresh database on every change:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/yc-software/qm
  tag: <release-sha>

publicUrl: https://qm.example.com

ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts: [qm.example.com]
  className: nginx
  clusterIssuer: letsencrypt-prod

secretEnv:
  DATABASE_URL: postgres://...
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: sk-ant-...
  CORE_SIGNING_SECRET: <random 32+ bytes>
  CAPABILITY_SECRET: <random 32+ bytes>
  PORTAL_IDENTITY_SECRET: <random 32+ bytes>
  CONNECTOR_SECRET_KEY: <random 32+ bytes>
  SKILL_SIGNING_SECRET: <random 32+ bytes>
  ADMIN_GRANTS: you@example.com:org_admin
  SANDBOX_BACKEND: local
```

Then install or upgrade:

```bash
helm upgrade --install qm deploy/helm \
  --namespace qm --create-namespace \
  -f my-values.yaml
```

[`deploy/helm/values.yaml`](../deploy/helm/values.yaml) lists every key, including the
per-service `services.<name>` blocks that control replicas, resources, and whether a
service is enabled at all. Secrets are scoped per service — see
[`docs/helm-per-service-secrets.md`](./helm-per-service-secrets.md).

## After the first install

The chart exposes `core` on the ingress and ships no identity provider. Core establishes
a browser-borne caller from a signed `x-portal-identity` header it verifies with
`PORTAL_IDENTITY_SECRET`, so signing anyone in requires putting something in front of core
that authenticates the user and mints that header. Until you do, core cannot sign anyone
in.

`AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAILS` still says who may be invited, and `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` with
`RESEND_API_KEY` lets admins email those invitations; neither authenticates anyone.

The first org admin comes from the operator, not from inside the product: set
`ADMIN_GRANTS` in `secretEnv` to a comma-separated list of `<principal>:org_admin`
entries — `you@example.com:org_admin,ops@example.com:org_admin`. `org_admin` is the only
role accepted; entries naming any other role are ignored. It is a one-time seed: core
writes it only when the grant table is still empty, so editing it later changes nothing
on an org that already has an admin. From then on grants are changed through the signed
admin API (`POST`/`DELETE /v1/admin/grants`) as an authenticated admin. With a durable
store (`DATABASE_URL`) and `ADMIN_GRANTS` unset, the org boots with no admin at all and
nothing inside the product can promote one. Grant changes and impersonation are
operator-only either way: both refuse agent tokens, so QM cannot make them on request.

Connector OAuth clients and the optional Slack bot token pair are set through core's
authenticated admin API. They are encrypted in durable storage and never belong in a
values file.

The QM repository has no production deployment workflow: each deployment runs in the
operator's own cluster. Keep your values file and any org-specific tools, skills, and
images in `deploy/layers/<org>/` in a private source fork, or in a separate private
repository — see [`deploy/layers/README.md`](../deploy/layers/README.md).
